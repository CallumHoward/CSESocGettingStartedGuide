        Tutor instructions

    <p>
        Before students arrive:
        <br />
        - Secure the tutor computer, turn on the screens and open up the first steps of lab0 on them. Zoom in if you need to make the font bigger.
        <br />
        - Take a rough count of students as they come in. It could be crowded so we have been instructed to be careful with OHS. Guide people to another lab if yours has no computers left. If all the labs are full, we have an overflow workshop set up in the K17 seminar room, and 2 guides to help people get there.
        <br />
        - Ask students to pick a seat at a computer
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        In the lab:
        <br />
        - Introduce and write your name on a whiteboard
        <br />
        - Give students a couple of minutes to say hello and introduce themselves to their neighbours
