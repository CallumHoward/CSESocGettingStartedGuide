      <p>Hello adventurer, on behalf of the School of CSE and the CSESoc student society, welcome to UNSW! Today, right here in 
        CSESoc's Getting Started Guide<sup>TM</sup> we are going to walk through using the CSE lab computers. Visit
        one the CSE labs (found here http://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/CSE_lab_map/) or if you aren't on campus just sit tight
        and follow along!</p>
      <p>You might be itching to get started, or you might be uncertain of what to expect, never fear! The GSG
        <sup>TM</sup> is here to answer your questions and calm your restless souls.</p>
      <p>Before we get started, take a moment to say hello to the people next to you, and by the way, the labs are for group 
        work and talking, no need to stay silent here!</p>
      <p>Along this first quest, and throughout the semester you will at times get bogged down and stuck, that's okay! You are
        not in this alone. Seek help from your fellow adventurers, or from a friendly and wise sage (your tutor!).</p>
      <p>Ok, so today we are taking it from the top. The aim is to get you familiar with the CSE Lab computers, and the basics
        of this thing called
        <em>Linux</em>.</p>
    </section>

      <p>Oh! I'm glad you asked. You may be thinking, I have my own computer or laptop. Maybe it's running a Windows or macOS
        <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/11southongeorgeb/the-purpose-of-an-operating-system">operating system</a>. That's totally fine, both of these work great for programming. But for true hacker street cred,
        you'll want to at least know the basics of Linux. Oh, plus you have to use the CSE computers to do your
        <strong>exams</strong> and submit
        <strong>assignments</strong>, important stuff!</p>

        <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="🧐" src="img/emoji/1f9d0.png">
      </h2>
      <p>The stuff that appears before the cursor is called a prompt. That just means that you can type and enter terminal commands.
        <br
        /> Let's try out our first command.</p>
      <p>Type</p>
      <pre><code>echo &quot;Quack&quot;</code></pre>
      <p>and press enter.</p>
      <p>It prints out "Quack", just like an echo right? Except in real life duck quacks don't echo (true fact!).
        <br /> Ok ok, let's try something a bit more interesting.</p>
      <p>Type</p>
      <pre><code>pwd</code></pre>
      <p>and press enter.</p>
      <p>Another name for folders is <i>directories</i>, and
        <code>pwd</code> is short for "
        <strong>P</strong>rint
        <strong>W</strong>orking
        <strong>D</strong>irectory", ie. print out the directory we are currently in. Since we just opened the terminal, we will
        be in the "home" directory. This is were we start when we open a new terminal.</p>

        <p>
          <img draggable="false" id="info-emoji" class="emoji" alt="ℹ️" src="img/emoji/2139.png"> Oh, so this is cool; any files or directories you put in your home folder can be accessed on any lab computer,

      <p>Ok then, these next ones will be some of your most used commands. Try entering this command:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">ls</code></pre>
      <p>
        <code>ls</code> is short for list, and it will list the files and sub-directories in the current directory.</p>
      <p>Here's another:</p>
      <pre><code>cd</code></pre>
      <p>&ndash; "
        <strong>c</strong>hange
        <strong>d</strong>irectory". It's like opening a folder!</p>
      <p>We have to tell the cd command which directory we want to change into however, so you can try</p>
      <pre><code>cd Desktop</code></pre>
      <p>To go back up to the
        <em>parent</em> directory, we can use</p>
      <pre><code>cd ..</code></pre>
      <p>Have a try!</p>

      <p>Sure can, the command is
        <code class="shell">mkdir</code>. Let's make a folder where you can store your coursework.</p>
      <p>Type</p>
      <pre><code>mkdir COMP1511</code></pre>
      <p>Now if you try
        <code>ls</code>, you should see that there is a new directory called "COMP1511".</p>
      <p>Now let's change into this directory, you remember how! You can use

      <p>True, but you will be
        <code>cd</code>-ing and
        <code>ls</code>-ing so much that it will be muscle memory in no time. Let's summarise:</p>

      <p>Here are a few terminal tips that will save you a tonne of time:</p>

      <section id="reuse-previous-commands" class="level3">
        <h3>Reuse previous commands</h3>
        <p>Hitting the "up" key will automatically place a previously executed command at the prompt. Going down, of course,
          does the opposite if you need it</p>
      </section>

      <section id="tab-completion" class="level3">
        <h3>Tab Completion</h3>
        <p>Essentially completes a filepath you have half-typed out so you don't have to waste precious milliseconds writing
          the rest of it. It is magical.</p>
        <p>You can try this out with the
          <code>cd</code> command. Make a folder with a really long name and then tab-complete the name when you cd into it. An example
          might be:</p>
        <div class="sourceCode" id="cb8">
          <pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="fu">mkdir</span> antidisestablishmentarianism<span>
<span class="sourceLine" id="cb8-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="bu">cd</span> anti<span class="op">&lt;</span>tab<span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="op">&lt;</span>enter<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>Try it, your life is now measurably better.</p>

      <section id="pasting-in-the-terminal" class="level3">
        <h3>Pasting in the terminal</h3>
        <p>Copy and past might work a bit differently from what you expect. Usually
          <code>Ctrl-c</code> is copy and
          <code>Ctrl-v</code> is paste. This will work in Firefox, but in terminal these keys have special meanings.
          <code>Ctrl-c</code> is used to abort the current program, and
          <code>Ctrl-v</code> is for inserting special characters. So how can you copy and paste then? All you have to do is 1. select the text
          you want to copy, 2. switch to your terminal (you can use
          <code>Alt-Tab</code>) and then, 3. click the middle mouse button (press down on the scroll wheel).</p>
        <p>You may also be able to right click in the terminal and choose paste, or use
          <code>Ctrl-Shift-v</code>.</p>

      <p>Now we get to the programming. To write programs we use a text editor. Here is a breakdown of your options on the CSE
        lab computers: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>gedit</code> - a graphical editor. -
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>nano</code> - a basic editor that you can use in a terminal. -
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>emacs</code> - an advanced editor with many, many shortcut keys, can be used in a terminal. -
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>vim</code> - another advanced editor, and it's the best one (I'm not biased at all!). It takes a while to learn. Works in a
          terminal.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For now we will start out with the easiest one,
        <code>gedit</code>. If you are feeling super confident and want to learn one of the advanced ones, come back and check out these links
        later:

    <section id="ok-how-do-we-get-started-with-gedit" class="level2">
      <h2>Ok, how do we get started with Gedit? 
        <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="😋" src="img/emoji/1f60b.png">
      </h2>
      <p>First,
        <code>cd</code> into your
        <code>COMP1511</code> directory, and then type:</p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb9">
        <pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="ex">gedit</span> hello.c <span class="kw">&amp;</span><span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>This will open the Gedit text editor in new window with a new file, "hello.c". The ampersand allows us to keep using
        the terminal while Gedit is open. Since this is probably the first time you have used Gedit, we want to set up some
        of the options. Here are the recommended settings:</p>
      <p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3sI7mEd.png" alt="screenshot Gedit settings 1" />

      </blockquote>
      <p>Now we can start to code! Our aim is to create a simple C program that can print out "hello world!". Type this code
        out into Gedit. It's okay if you don't understand it just yet.</p>

      <p>Be careful to get all the symbols and spacing correct. For line 7, you can get 4 spaces at the start of the line by
        pressing
        <code>&lt;Tab&gt;</code>. Line 7 and line 9 have semicolons (
        <code>;</code>) at the end.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>A rough explanation of the code goes something like this: - Every program we write has a
        <em>main</em> function that looks like this on line 5.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Inside the main function (between the
          <code>{</code> curly brackets
          <code>}</code>) we put our code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>printf</code> comes from the
          <code>stdio.h</code> file that we included at the top. It prints out some formatted text.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then on line 9 we finish the program and
          let the Operating System know that everything turned out successfully. All according to plan!
          <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> comes from the
          <code>stdlib.h</code> file that we included.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Again, don't worry! You will go over this again in more detail in your lectures, this is just to get your feet wet.
        You might be wondering what the
        <code>\n</code> is on line 7, that's a "newline character", which will just insert a new line when outputting to the terminal.</p>

      <h2>How do we run it? 
        <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="🤪" src="img/emoji/1f92a.png">
      </h2>
      <p>Well first we have to compile our code.
        <strong>Save</strong> the file and switch back to the terminal from before. If you list the files in the current directory
        now with
        <code>ls</code>, you should see our new file
        <code>hello.c</code>. Now we can use the
        <code>gcc</code> command to
        <em>compile</em> our code into a program that the computer can understand. Try typing out this command, and double check
        it is the same before hitting enter:</p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb10">
        <pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="fu">gcc</span> -Wall -Werror -o hello hello.c</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>That is a lowercase letter o by the way. If there is no output, then that means it worked. If it prints some errors,
        go back to Gedit and check that everything is the same as the picture.</p>
      <p>Now if you run
        <code>ls</code> again, there should be a new item called "hello". Just remember, our code is the file that ends in
        <code>.c</code>, and our program is whatever we put after the
        <code>-o</code> in our compile command.</p>
      <p>Now that it is all compiled, let's run our program. Just type:</p>
      <pre><code>./hello</code></pre>
      <p>That is, a dot and then a slash and then the name of our program.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>Yup! You have written your first program. Feel free to experiment with the code and change the message, just remember
        if you change the code, you will have to compile it again before running it.</p>

      <p>Yes you can! There are a few different ways to do this. - Remotely connect to the CSE servers using SSH via the internet
        - Write and compile on macOS, Windows - Install Linux on your computer</p>
      <p>There are guides on how to do that here:

      <p>That's pretty much it. I'll just leave you with a couple of tips. You will be using these three snippets for every
        program you write, so I recommend just rote learning them. Spend a short amount of time getting faster at typing
        them out, and then when it comes to writing more programs you will know how to get started quickly.</p>
